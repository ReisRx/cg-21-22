# Lab 4

## Exercise

Adapt CGr-P/src6/transforms.py (since I am doing this on C++ create from scratch) to explore the effect of local and global transformations of a 3D object modeled by yourself.

## Rationale

Envisaging a future animation to be developed by your team, it is now proposed that each one starts modeling a 3D object.

Later, in individual assignments, you will be asked to:

  + incorporate the objects created by the other members of your team into a scene
  + consider that multiple cameras exist
  + add texture and
  + add light and shades to the scene.

Finally, the team, you will be asked to integrate a particular feature (such as physically based animation or other technique) in a game or a video clip.

## Methodology

For the current assignment, the proposed methodology is:

  + Choice of a 3D modeling tool of your choice. The recommend tool is [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)). If you choose another tool, present your reasons.
  + Familiarize yourself with the modeling tool by modeling and exporting the vertices of a simple object like a [cuboid](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cuboid.html).
  + Model the object of your choice. You may base your work in a existing model (remembering to document your sources) but significant changes must be made.
  + Substitute the triangle in src6/transforms.py by the model you just created.
